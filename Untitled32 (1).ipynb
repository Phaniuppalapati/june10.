    "In Python, the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function lies in their origin and how they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Built-in functions: Built-in functions are functions that are pre-defined in the Python language and are readily available for use without the need for any additional code or import statements. These functions are part of Python's standard library and cover a wide range of tasks, such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, file handling, etc. They are implemented in C and integrated into the Python\n",
    "interpreter, providing essential functionality to programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a built-in function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The len() function is a built-in function that returns the length (the number of items) of an object like a string, list, or tuple. Here's an example\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "length = len(my_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(length) # Output: 13\n",
    "\n",
    "2. User-defined functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined functions are functions that are created by the users themselves to perform\n",
    "specific tasks or operations. These functions are defined using the\n",
    "\n",
    "def keyword followed by a function name, parentheses for optional parameters, and a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can define the functionality of the function by writing the required code within the function's body. Once defined, user-defined functions can be called from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a user-defined function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a user- defined function named\n",

    "\n",
    "In summary, built-in functions are provided by the Python language itself and are readily available, while user-defined functions are created by the users to tailor the program's functionality to their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2\n",
    "In Python, there are two primary ways to pass arguments to a function: positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positional arguments: Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order. The values of the arguments are assigned to the function parameters in the same order as they are provided when calling the function. The number of arguments and their positions must match the function's parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of positional arguments:\n",
    "Example of positional arguments:\n",

    "print(\"Hello, \" + name\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "+\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first argument \"Alice\" is assigned to the `name parameter, and the second argument 25 is assigned to the\n",
    "\n",
    "`age parameter. The output will be: \"Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keyword arguments: Keyword arguments are passed to a function using the names of the parameters as keywords. This way\n",
    "the order of the arguments does not matter as long as they are associated with the correct parameter names. Keyword arguments are useful when you want to explicitly specify which parameter each value corresponds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet (name, age): print(\"Hello,\" + name +\n",
    "\n",
    "greet (age=30, name =^ prime prime Bob^ prime prime )\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the arguments are passed using their parameter\n",
    "names. The order is different from the function definition, but the output will still be: \"Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also mix positional and keyword arguments in a function call. However, positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when defining a function, you can also set default values for parameters. These default values will be used if no argument is provided for that parameter when calling the function. This allows for more flexibility in function calls and makes certain arguments optional.\n",

    "hand, are defined using the `def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for arguments, a colon, and the function body, which can contain multiple statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Function Name: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they do not have a name. They are defined inline at the point where they are used or assigned to variables. Regular functions have a defined name that can be used to call them from different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scope: Lambda functions have their own local scope, but they can also access variables from the enclosing scope (lexical scoping).\n",
    "Regular functions create their own\n",
